</p>
        
<p>
<strong>Pre-Purchase Inspections</strong>
</p>
        
<p>The pre-purchase inspection is a full assessment of the aircraft in relation to its technical condition and status of the maintenance programs (required by the manufacturer and the civil aviation authority). Part of this process is the preparation of a report of discrepancies on the actual condition of the aircraft. This provides reliability to the business. It does not include the oversight of maintenance.
</p>
        <p>Main items of the pre-purchase inspection:
          </p>
          </p>
•	Analysis of engine performance and vibration tests.<br />
•	Inspection of the windscreens and windows for cracks and deformations.<br />
•	Inspection for general corrosion at critical points in the structure.<br />
•	Functional testing of the entire electrical and electronic system.<br />
•	Analysis of all technical documentation for the evaluation of overdue (or overdue) items and applicable service bulletins.<br />

<p>

<p>
<strong>Aircraft Valuation</strong>
</p>
        
<p>Whether your company is a Bank that financed an aircraft; or offered your aircraft for subleasing, it is necessary from time to time to check the status of your asset. The aircraft has to guarantee the debt, and in case there is need of repossession, the records may have to be rebuilt. For this, periodic evaluations must be carried out by a team with experience in this activity.
</p>
        <p>Main aircraft assessment items:
          </p>
          </p>
•	Verification of the Airworthiness Condition of the asset.<br />
•	Checking the Aircraft Cleaning and Conservation Status.<br />
•	Obtaining Information, if necessary, to recompose the Aircraft Logbooks.<br />
•	Data Collection for Verification of Resale Value of the Aircraft.<br />
<p>

<strong>Safety Inspection</strong>
</p>
        
<p>Before embarking their executives on a chartered aircraft, it is of interest to evaluate the quality and safety of the operations, as well as the maintenance status of the aircraft made available for the service.
</p>
        <p>Main items to be observed:
          </p>
          </p>
•	Verification of airworthiness of aircraft (records and physical inspection).<br />
•	Verification of Maintenance Control and Engineering of the company.<br />
•	Verification of training records for the pilots who will be approved for the operation.<br />
•	Security Inspection at the origin, destination and alternate airports.<br />

<p>

<strong>Heavy Maintenance Oversight</strong>
</p>
        
<p>From time to time, aircraft must comply with a heavy maintenance inspection, when the aircraft is grounded for more than one month and when some systems – usually inaccessible – are verified. This is also an opportunity to comply with certain Service Bulletins – or for some upgrades. More than that, this may present a chance to replace some components with the up-to-date version, improving the reliability and preventing a higher cost of having to access it in the future. While most Directors of Maintenance will only witness a few heavy maintenance events in his professional life, this is my day-to-day job. When a professional oversees a heavy maintenance event, he can give advice, keep the costs low and ensure the repair station is being fair in the billing process.
</p>
        <p>Main service items:
          </p>
          </p>
•	Presence in the repair station to be the “eyes” of the customer and evaluate “in loco” any discrepancy/squawk.<br />
•	Verification of good care with the aircraft and aircraft interior. <br />
•	Verification and approval of discrepancies and assessment of items that, despite being airworthy, may fail or have the end of economic life in the near future.<br />
•	Assessment and review of the invoice, checking the times charged and the parts installed for accuracy and fairness. <br />

<strong>STC Development and Approval</strong>
</p>
<p>After the pandemic, the demand for business jets increased and the number of pre-flown aircraft available in the market plummeted. What makes even more difficult to bring some older aircraft to operation is the fact that some suppliers also left the market, and some components became obsolete. Changes to the type design require certification, and this approval can be done by means of a Supplemental Type Certificate.
</p>
        <p>Main service characteristic items:
          </p>
          </p>
•	Determination of the best way to obtain the approval and document it.<br />
•	Management of the project, from the determination of the change to its approval.<br />
•	Verification of conformity of the change in the aircraft with the approved data.<br />
•	Filing the documents with the affected authority.<br />
